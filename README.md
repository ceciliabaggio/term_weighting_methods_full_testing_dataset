# Term Weighting Methods

This code is made available to reproduce the experiments that were sent for publication in PeerJ journal.

The source code of the term-weighting methods has been developed by Mariano Maisonnave (https://cs.uns.edu.ar/~mmaisonnave/)

The zipped datasets need to be in the same dir as the Jupyter notebook **weighting_methods_with_mogp_metrics.ipynb**

For the experiment you need approximately 130gb of RAM. First add the zipped datasets to the directory and run the Jupyter Notebook.


You can download the datasets from: https://csunseduar-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cb_cs_uns_edu_ar/Eu1xqiOSt8NCjmuvaMhIsyoBpvSv1VKeYhkwxPbYIbrYzA?e=bSFbxT

The datasets are also available on Mendeley: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9mpgz8z257/1 

If you find any issue, please write me an email (cb@cs.uns.edu.ar) and I will be glad to see what is going on :)
