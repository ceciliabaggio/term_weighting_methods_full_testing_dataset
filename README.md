# Term Weighting Methods

This code is made available to reproduce the experiments that were sent for publication in PeerJ journal.

The zipped datasets need to be in the same dir as the Jupyter notebook **weighting_methods_with_mogp_metrics_no_long_out.ipynb**

For the experiment you need approximately 130gb of RAM. First add the zipped datasets to the directory and run the Jupyter Notebook.


You can download the datasets from: https://csunseduar-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cb_cs_uns_edu_ar/Eu1xqiOSt8NCjmuvaMhIsyoBpvSv1VKeYhkwxPbYIbrYzA?e=bSFbxT

If you find any issue, please write me an email (cb@cs.uns.edu.ar) and I will be glad to see what is going on :)
